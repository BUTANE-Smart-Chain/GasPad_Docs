# KYC

KYC is only for Project Owners

At GasPad, we prioritize the safety of our investors. We are committed to preventing scams and rugpulls, and have developed numerous features and tools to help you make informed decisions about whether a presale is worth investing in.

You may have noticed that several projects have a KYC badge next to their names. This article explains what that means and what it entails for all stakeholders.

## KYC Explained

At GasPad, Know Your Customer, or KYC, is the process of identity verification to ensure that the person speaking to us is who they claim to be. This is achieved by submitting ID documentation (Passport, National ID) to an automated platform, similar to the KYC process required when opening a trading account on a major exchange like Binance.

## What Does it Mean For You?

The KYC process aims to rid our platform of scams and rugpulls by acting as a deterrent for dubious developers. If any of the KYCed project’s team members scams investors: 
- We will reveal their identities.
- We will make this information public for those wanting to file criminal charges.

To investors: If you have serious reservations about a project, and you have evidence that the project is a scam, please contact us ASAP, supplying as much evidence as possible. We will investigate the claim and inform you of the result of our investigation. 

To project owners: If you want investors to trust you, we highly recommend that you approach our team and apply for KYC verification. This will bring legitimacy to your project. KYC may take 24 - 48 hours so please contact us asap. 

The KYC service on GasPad is another of the great features making our platform the best launchpad available. It will also help further in cleaning up the crypto industry, making people realize that they are accountable for their actions, even in a decentralized world. 

## Doxx Badge
