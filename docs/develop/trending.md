# Trending

GasPad provides every project with the opportunity to trend on our website. The launchpad highlights the top 12 trending projects at any given time and dynamically adjusts their position based on the performance of the token and its fundraising success.

The trending bar is controlled via a smart algorithm that has been designed to keep trending fair, while also having the ability to remove projects that try to manipulate the algorithm.

Some of the trending metrics are listed below:
- Buy volume —> the more buy volume on your presale pool, the higher you will trend.
- ​KYC and Audit badges —> projects with these badges will get higher priority over projects without these badges.
- ​SAFU badge —> projects with this badge will get the highest priority with regards to trending.
- ​Community engagement —> projects with more community engagement will get more scores to trend.

> Tip: If you want to better your chances at trending, combine the above metrics. However, please note that these will not guarantee you a trending position. The algorithm will assess project popularity and adjust accordingly.

Lastly, we advise project owners NOT to pay external parties for "GasPad Trending" services as they are likely a scam. Our smart algorithm will detect fraudulent trending behaviours and blacklist the project, so it is best to follow our tips above.

> Note: Again, GasPad Trending is free. If there are people approaching you for GasPad Trending, they are definitely scammers. Please report and block them.
