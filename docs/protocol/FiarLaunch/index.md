# Create a FairLaunch

Here's how to Create a fair launch on GasPad, ensuring that all participants get the same token price, regardless of when they purchase during the launch period. The token price equals the total raised BBC divided by the total tokens for fair launch.

## Step 1: Verify Token

1. Connect your wallet.
2. Visit our platform.
3. Input your token address if you have one already, or create a new token for the Fair Launch.
4. Select BBC (if you're planning to raise funds using a stable coin for your presale, check our guide for this).
5. Choose a fee option.
6. MetaMask will now prompt you to confirm the transaction and display the fee that you need to pay. If you agree, click on the “Confirm” button to complete the process.

> **Note:** Ensure that your token has the 'Exclude transfer fee' function if it carries transfer fees. Stablecoin pairings work only with standard tokens and don't support taxed tokens.

## Step 2: Provide Fair Launch Information

After verifying your token, input the Fair Launch information, adhering to the following important parameters:

1. Use positive numbers only.
2. The total selling amount indicates the number of tokens to be sold during the presale stage.
3. Ensure that the softcap is a reasonable number.
4. Specify the maximum contribution per user during the fair launch.
5. Select a router like PancakeSwap.
6. Liquidity (%): State the percentage of raised funds that should be allocated to liquidity on the router you selected. The minimum value is 51%, maximum is 100%.
7. The start time must be earlier than the end time.
8. Specify the lock-up period for the liquidity pool, e.g., 365 days.

## Step 3: Add Additional Info

In this step:

1. The logo URL and website are mandatory fields.
2. The logo URL should end with a supported image extension: png, jpg, jpeg, or gif.
   For example: https://www.gaspad.io/gaspad.png
3. Click Next after providing all information.

## Step 4: Finish

In this final step, review all the information one last time before submitting. Click “Submit” when you're sure everything is correct, or you can go back to the previous step to make changes.

After clicking on “Submit”, MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction and show you the fee for the transaction. If you agree, click on the “Confirm” button to complete the process.

And there you have it! You've successfully set up a fair launch on GasPad.
