# How To Withdraw Your Contrubution 

After participating in and purchasing a token on a presale through GasPad, if the soft cap was not reached, you'll need to wait until the presale has ended to withdraw your contribution.

You will see a popup at the bottom left-hand corner like this:

Check the balance of your wallet to confirm that the BBC (or MATIC, FANTOM, ETH, depending on the pool) has been returned.
