# How to Buy a Presale

## How to Participate in a Presale on GasPad:

1. Visit our platform.
2. You can filter the presale statuses by selecting from the "Filter By" list. You only can buy a presale with the “In-progress” status.
3. Hover over a presale you want and click on “View Pool”.
4. After clicking on “View Pool”, you can see all the information related to that presale. You should check everything carefully before buying.
5. To buy the presale, insert the amount of BBC (or FTM, MATIC or ETH, depending on the pool) that you want to use to buy in the “Amount” section. The corresponding amount of presale tokens will be calculated automatically below the BBC amount. Finally, click on the “Buy” button.
6. MetaMask will now ask you to confirm the transaction. It will also show you the fee that you are required to pay for that transaction. If you agree, then click on the “Confirm” button to finish the process.
7. After buying, you will see the changes in the “Amount” and “Your purchased” sections. For this pool, the maximum buy is 3 BBC, if you purchased 0.1 BBC, the amount would change to 2.9 BBC (= 3 – 0.1).
