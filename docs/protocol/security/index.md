# Create a standard Token

Here's how to create a standard token with GasPad using your MetaMask wallet on your desktop:

1. From the GasPad homepage, click on “Create” – “Token”.
2. You'll be redirected to the token creation page.
3. To create a standard type token, in the "Token Type" section, choose “Standard Token”.
4. Click on “Create token” after you've filled in all required fields. 

*Notes:*
- Decimals must be greater than or equal to 2. 
- All fields are required; they cannot be left blank. 
- Decimals and the total supply must be a positive number.

5. MetaMask will now ask you to confirm the transaction. It will also show you the fee that you are required to pay for that transaction. If you agree, then click on the “Confirm” button to finish the process.
