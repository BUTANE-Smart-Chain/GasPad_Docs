# $GAS Tokenomics

**$GAS Token Contract:** `0x......`  

## Token Distribution

**Total Supply:** 100 million $GAS tokens
- **Public Sale:** 40% of total supply
- **Team and Advisors:** 20% of total supply (vested over 2 years)
- **Ecosystem Growth:** 15% of total supply (reserved for partnerships, grants, and future initiatives)
- **Community Rewards:** 25% of total supply (airdrops, staking rewards, and promotional campaigns)

## Token Supply Mechanics

- **Inflation:** An annual inflation rate of 2% for the $BBC token incentivizes network participation and helps secure the network. This inflation is designed to reward users who actively contribute to the platform's growth and stability.
- **Deflationary Mechanism:** A portion of the network's revenue is used for buyback-and-burn mechanisms to create deflationary pressure on both $BBC and $GAS tokens. By reducing the overall token supply over time, this strategy aims to increase the value of the remaining tokens in circulation.

## Staking and Rewards

- **$BBC Staking:** Users can stake their $BBC tokens to earn a portion of the transaction fees generated on the network. This mechanism encourages long-term holding and active participation in the ecosystem.
- **$GAS Staking:** Users can stake their $GAS tokens to participate in governance and earn a share of the platform's revenue. This feature rewards token holders for their involvement in shaping the project's future and for helping maintain the platform's stability.

## Governance

The $GAS token is designed to empower its holders by granting them governance rights, which include:

- **Voting Rights:** $GAS token holders can submit and vote on proposals related to the DAO, influencing the project's direction and development.
- **Delegation:** Token holders can delegate their voting power to other users, enabling a more dynamic and inclusive decision-making process.
- **Proposal Threshold:** Users must meet a minimum $GAS token holding requirement to submit proposals. This mechanism ensures that only dedicated and committed members of the community can influence the project's direction.
- **Quorum Requirements:** A minimum quorum is established for voting on proposals, ensuring that decisions are made with the support of a significant portion of the token holder community.

Through these carefully designed tokenomics, the $GAS DAO token project aims to create a balanced and sustainable ecosystem that delivers long-term value and utility for its users. By combining various token utilities, staking rewards, governance mechanisms, and token supply management strategies, the project seeks to foster a thriving community of engaged, committed, and empowered participants.
