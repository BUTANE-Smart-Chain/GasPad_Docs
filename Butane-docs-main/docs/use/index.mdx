# ✨ Getting started

### Welcome to the go-to portal for in-depth information about the Butane Network ($BBC) platform and ecosystem and how to interact with them!

## What is Butane Network?

Butane is a blockchain network that enables a new generation of applications built by developers across the world. Using and building on the network is permissionless, so you can get started right now without any authorization.

We believe that you shouldn't be constrained to interacting with applications on only one blockchain. That's why at Butane, we enable developers to create applications "cross-chain" that are accessible from multiple chains. As a result, 

you can seamlessly interact with applications on Butane without having to know what underlying blockchain they are built on.

## What are dApps?

Butane hosts a rich ecosystem of decentralized applications [dApps](https://butane.tech/) that are disrupting traditional ideas from finance, creative ownership, gaming, governance, and more. A dApp is called "decentralized" as it doesn't rely on a centralized entity and instead gives back ownership to the community.

A dApp's core business logic is implemented through smart contracts. These contracts execute code over a decentralized network (Butane) that is publicly visible. A centralized application (e.g. Airbnb) instead executes code in a privately regulated environment such as the application’s own servers.

## What can you do on Butane.tech?

Once connected to the Butane network, you can send money peer-to-peer without the need for banks or payment services or interact with cross-chain dApps.




Alongside the applications built by the developer community, the Butane Core Development Team also builds its own dApps. Here are some examples:

* [Assets](https://butane.tech/) - View, withdraw, and deposit cross-chain tokens like a bank account
* [Staking](https://butane.tech/) - Help keep the network stable, by staking your tokens and earning a daily interest on your stake.
* [Governance](https://butane.tech/) - Butane is known for hosting one of the most active governance in the blockchain space.

## ButaneNetwork

Butane Blockchain represents the next generation of blockchain platforms, designed to provide a user-friendly, secure, and scalable environment

 for building decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) services. By combining the strengths of existing platforms
 
 with cutting-edge technologies and a strong focus on user experience, Butane Blockchain aims to drive mass adoption of decentralized technologies
 
 and create a thriving ecosystem for developers and users alike.

In this whitepaper, we will explore the core components and features of the Butane Blockchain platform, including its consensus mechanism, 

smart contract capabilities, tokenomics, and ecosystem. We will also discuss the platform's roadmap, team, and governance structure, as well as its focus on interoperability, scalability, and developer support

To get started, read about how to connect your wallet, transfer tokens and interact with dApps in the following sections. If you want to start building cross-chain applications on Butane, head over to the development section.
