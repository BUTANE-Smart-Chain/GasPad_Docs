# Token Utility

GasPad tokens (#GASPAD) are not just another token in the crypto space. They are the lifeblood of the GasPad ecosystem, providing a multitude of utilities that enhance the user experience and add value to our holders.

**1. Fee Payment:** Use #GASPAD to pay for any fees on our platform. This includes transaction fees, listing fees, and any other service charges. This provides a seamless experience for our users and integrates #GASPAD into every aspect of our platform.

**2. Buyback and Burn:** To ensure the stability and value of the #GASPAD token, we will use 20% of our profits every quarter to buy back #GASPAD tokens from the open market and burn them. This reduces the overall supply of #GASPAD over time, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens.

**3. Access to Exclusive Features:** Holding #GASPAD may grant users access to exclusive features and benefits on the GasPad platform, such as early access to new features, discounted fees, and more.

By holding #GASPAD, you're not just owning a token; you're becoming a part of the GasPad community and contributing to the growth and success of the platform.
