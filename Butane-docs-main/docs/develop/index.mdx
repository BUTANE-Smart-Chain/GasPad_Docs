# ðŸ”¥ Getting Started

Following this documentation and our academy you can learn how to build a dApp on Butane and become part of the rich
ecosystem of EVM builders. Whether you are building new use cases on Butane or porting an existing dApp from
another chain, you'll want to check out the sections on

1. Building and deploying [EVM Smart Contracts](./develop/smart-contracts)
2. Building a web3 [Frontend](./develop/build-a-dApp/build-a-frontend#wallet-integration) that supports Keplr and Metamask
3. Using a [Backend](./develop/create-backend) to create a seamless web3 experience
4. Available developer [Tools](./tools/index.md)


Once tested on [Testnet](./../develop/testnet) and deployed on [Mainnet](./../develop/mainnet), you can
start [earning an income](./../develop/mainnet#revenue) on transaction fees from interacting with your dApp or
[register your tokens](./../develop/mainnet#token-registration) for cross-chain use.

import { chainConfig, handler } from '@site/src/utils/ChainConfig';

:::tip
Add Butane Testnet to Keplr.

## Why develop dApps on Butane?

The Butane Core Development Team is on a mission to provide the foundational tools necessary for building the cross-chain
applications of the future, freeing developers from the confines of todayâ€™s siloed blockchains.

Butane focuses on cross-chain **innovation** so that developers can build entirely new dApp experiences for their users.
Deploying smart contracts on Butane is **easy**, as the Butane blockchain is fully compatible with Ethereum and its rich
ecosystem of robust tooling, wallets, explorers, a surplus of assets, and intelligent end-users. At the same time,
Butane allows developers to build **scalable** EVM dApp chains with the upcoming Butane SDK and it hosts one of the
most active community governance that seeks **fairness** across all key actors (users, builders, and validators).

Butane does this by leveraging the interoperability of the Cosmos Ecosystem and the market-dominating support for EVM
development. This allows dApp developers to use Ethereum smart contracts to implement the business logic on-chain
while having access to Cosmos chain functionalities, such as exchanging value with the rest of the Cosmos Ecosystem
through the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).

## Contributors

You can also contribute to the Butane ecosystem without building a dApp. Head over to [tools](./tools/index.md) to learn
how to contribute as a full-stack developer by building new dev tools or [protocol](../protocol) to help
out building the core protocol.
