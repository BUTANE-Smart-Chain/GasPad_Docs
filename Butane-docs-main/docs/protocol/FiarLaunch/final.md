# Finalize a FairLaunch

After your Fair Launch has reached its soft cap on GasPad, follow these steps to list your token:

1. Visit our platform.
2. Click on “My Contributions”. Your pool should be visible here.
3. You can only finalize a Fair Launch that has a “Sale Ended” status. In this example, let's assume it’s GasPadTestToken. Hover your mouse over the GasPadTestToken section and click on “View Pool”.
4. In the “Pool Actions” section, you can choose to click on “Finalize” to complete the Fair Launch and list your token, or you can choose to cancel it.

> **Note:** To finalize your Fair Launch, ensure you exclude all types of fees, taxes, and rewards for presale addresses.

5. MetaMask will now ask you to confirm the transaction. It will also show you the fee that you are required to pay for that transaction. If you agree, then click on the “Confirm” button to finish the process.

And that's it! You've successfully finalized a Fair Launch on GasPad and your token is now listed.
