# How to Unlock
## Unlock Tokens Without Vesting

When the locking cycle ends, project owners can go to GasLock page and unlock the locked tokens by clicking on the “Unlock” button.

1. Visit our platform.
2. Connect your wallet.
3. Click on "My Lock".
4. Click on "View".
5. Click on "Unlock".
6. MetaMask will now ask you to confirm the transaction. It will also show you the fee that you are required to pay for that transaction. If you agree, then click on the “Confirm” button to finish the process.

## Renounce Lock Ownership

To renounce ownership, click on "Renounce Lock Ownership". Renouncing ownership will transfer ownership to a dead wallet preventing you from interacting, unlocking or removing the liquidity/tokens at the end of the lock. Only do this if you fully understand how renouncing works and the outcome. We accept no liability for any loss occurred to any person acting or refraining from action as a result of this process.

## Unlock Vesting Tokens

When each vesting cycle ends, project owners can go to GasLock page and unlock the vested tokens by clicking on the “Unlock” button.

For example: If, for any reason, project owners are not able to withdraw their vested tokens when a cycle expires, they can do this at any given time afterwards. If they were to wait till the next cycle expires, the total amount that can be withdrawn at that time would be the balance of the previous cycle amount plus the amount of tokens of the recently expired cycle.
