# Emergency Withdraw

After participating in and purchasing a token on presale via GasPad, if you change your mind and want to withdraw your contribution back, you can use the "Emergency Withdraw" button for a penalty fee of 10% of your contribution.

1. From the presale/fairlaunch/subscription page on GasPad, click on the "Emergency Withdraw" button.
2. Click on "Ok" to confirm the emergency withdrawal process.
3. After clicking on “OK”, MetaMask will now ask you to confirm the transaction. It will also show you the fee that you are required to pay for that transaction. If you agree, then click on the “Confirm” button to finish the process.

*Note:*  
Emergency withdrawal deducts your contribution (with a 10% penalty) out of the Presale Pool.  
You can use the "Emergency Withdraw" button anytime until the last 15 minutes before a presale timer runs out.  
If the hard cap is reached faster than the timer, then you can use the "Emergency Withdraw" button until the timer for the presale would run out.
