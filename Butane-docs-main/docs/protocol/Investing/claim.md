# How to claim Tokens

After taking part in and purchasing a token on a presale via GasPad, the next step is to claim your tokens. 

In the event that the soft cap/hard cap has been reached, you can claim your tokens once the “Claim token” button is available. The amount of tokens that you can claim will also be shown next to the “Claim token” button. 

MetaMask will now ask you to confirm the transaction. It will also show you the fee that you are required to pay for that transaction. If you agree, then click on the “Confirm” button to finish the process. 

Check your wallet balance to see the presale tokens. We recommend that you follow the social media channels of the project to check their updates.
