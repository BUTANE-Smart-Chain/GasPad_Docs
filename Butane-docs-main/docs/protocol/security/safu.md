# Simple Arrangement for Funding Upload (SAFU)

The [Simple Arrangement for Funding Upload (the "SAFU")](https://github.com/orgs/BUTANE-Smart-Chain/repositories)
outlines the post-exploit policy for active vulnerabilities in the Butane blockchain.
The SAFU is intended for white hat hackers
and outlines the process for returning funds and calculating rewards
for vulnerabilities found in the network.
In summary, the SAFU states the following:

* Hackers are not at risk of legal action if they act in accordance
  with the SAFU.
* Hackers have a Grace Period to return any exploited funds
  to a specified dropbox address and can claim a reward of
  a Bounty Percent of the total funds secured up to the Bounty Cap.
* The rewards are distributed during the next upgrade of the network.
* If the reward is valued above a specified threshold amount,
  white hat hackers should go through
  a Know Your Clients/Know Your Business (KYC/KYB) process.
* Exploiting vulnerabilities for malicious purposes
  will make a hacker ineligible for any rewards.
* White hat hackers are not entitled to any rewards from the team or network
  for funds from "Out of Scope Projects" (other projects that were exploited
  by hackers but do not have their own SAFU program).
