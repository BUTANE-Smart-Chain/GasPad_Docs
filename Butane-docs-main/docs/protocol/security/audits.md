# Create a Liquidity Generator Token

Here's how to create a Liquidity Generator Token (SafeMoon Fork) with GasPad using the desktop version of the Metamask Wallet:

1. From the GasPad homepage, click on “Create” – “Token”.
2. You will be redirected to the token creation page.
3. To create a Liquidity Generator Token, in the "Token Type" section, choose “Liquidity Generator Token”.
4. Input all necessary information. Here's a brief explanation of the crucial fields that need to be filled:

   - Transaction fee to generate yield (%): The % amount of tokens from every transaction that are distributed to all token holders.
   - Transaction fee to generate liquidity (%): The % amount of tokens from every transaction that are distributed to the liquidity pool.
   - Max transaction percent (%): Any transactions that trade more than this percentage of the total supply will be rejected.
   - Charity percent (%):  The % amount of tokens from every transaction are distributed to a charity address.
   - Charity address: All charity tokens from “Charity percent (%)” will be distributed to this address.

   Example: Let's say you create a GasLambo token with these parameters: Token name: GasLambo. Symbol: GLB. Total supply: 100000 GLB. Every transaction incurs a fee of 10% to the benefit of all holders, of which: 5% are distributed among all diamond hands holders.
