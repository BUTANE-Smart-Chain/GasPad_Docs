# butane CLI

`butanesd` is the all-in-one command-line interface (CLI). It allows you to run an butane node, manage wallets and interact
 with the butane network through queries and transactions. This introduction will explain how to install the `butaned`
 binary onto your system and guide you through some simple examples how to use butaned.

## Prerequisites

#### Go

butane is built using [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) version `1.20+`. Check your version with:

```bash
go version
```

Once you have installed the right version, confirm that your [`GOPATH`](https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code#GOPATH)
 is correctly configured by running the following command and adding it to your shell startup script:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

#### jq

butane scripts are using [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) version `1.6+`. Check your version with:

```
jq --version
```

## Installation

You can build and install the `butaned` binaries from source or using Docker.

### Build From Source

Clone and build the butane from source using `git`. The `<tag>` refers to a release tag on Github. The latest butane
 [version](https://github.com/butane/butane/releases) is <ProjectValue keyword='latest_version'/>:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/butane/butane.git
cd butane
git fetch
git checkout <tag>
make install
```

After installation is done, check that the butaned binaries have been successfully installed:

```bash
butaned version
```

:::info
If the `butaned: command not found` error message is returned, confirm that you have configured [Go](#go) correctly.
:::

### Docker

When it comes to using Docker with butane, there are two options available:
Build a binary of the butane daemon inside a dockerized build environment
or build a Docker image, that can be used to spin up individual containers running the butane binary.
For information on how to achieve this,
proceed to the dedicated page on [working with Docker](./docker-build.md).

## Run an butane node

To become familiar with butane, you can run a local blockchain node that produces blocks and exposes EVM and Cosmos
endpoints. This allows you to deploy and interact with smart contracts locally or test core protocol functionality.

Run the local node by executing the `local_node.sh` script in the base directory of the repository:

```bash
./local_node.sh
```

The script stores the node configuration including the local default endpoints under `~/.tmp-butaned/config/config.toml`.
If you have previously run the script, the script allows you to overwrite the existing configuration and start a new
local node.

Once your node is running you will see it validating and producing blocks in your local butane blockchain:

```bash
12:59PM INF executed block height=1 module=state num_invalid_txs=0 num_valid_txs=0 server=node
# ...
1:00PM INF indexed block exents height=7 module=txindex server=node
```

For more information on how to customize a local node,
head over to the [Single Node](./butane-cli/single-node) page.

## Using `butaned`

After installing the `butaned` binary, you can run commands using:

```bash
butaned [command]
```

There is also a `-h`, `--help` command available

```bash
butaned -h
```

It is possible to maintain multiple node configurations at the same time. To specify a configuration use the `--home`
flag. In the following examples we will be using the default config for a local node, located at `~/.tmp-butaned`.

### Manage wallets

You can manage your wallets using the butaned binary to store private keys and sign transactions over CLI. To view all
keys use:

```bash
butaned keys list \
--home ~/.tmp-butaned \
--keyring-backend test

# Example Output:
# - address: butane19xnmslvl0pcmydu4m52h2gf0std5ee5pfgpyuf
#   name: dev0
#   pubkey: '{"@type":"/ethermint.crypto.v1.ethsecp256k1.PubKey","key":"AzKouyoUL0UUS1qRUZdqyVsTPkCAFWwxx3+BTOw36nKp"}'
#   type: local
```

You can generate a new key/mnemonic with a `$NAME` with:

```bash
butaned keys add [name] \
--home ~/.tmp-butaned \
--keyring-backend test
```

To export your butane key as an Ethereum private key (for use with [Metamask](./../../../use/connect-your-wallet/metamask)
 for example):

```bash
butaned keys unsafe-export-eth-key [name] \
--home ~/.tmp-butaned \
--keyring-backend test
```

For more about the available key commands, use the `--help` flag

```bash
butaned keys -h
```

### Interact with a Network

You can use butaned to query information or submit transactions on the blockchain. Queries and transactions are requests
 that you send to an butane node through the Tendermint RPC.

:::tip
ðŸ‘‰ To use the CLI, you will need to provide a Tendermint RPC address for the `--node` flag.
Look for a publicly available addresses for testnet and mainnet in the [Networks](./../../develop/api/networks) page.
:::

#### Set Network Config

In the local setup the node is set to `tcp://localhost:26657`. You can view your node configuration with:

```bash
butaned config \
--home ~/.tmp-butaned
# Example Output
# {
# 	"chain-id": "butane_9000-1",
# 	"keyring-backend": "test",
# 	"output": "text",
# 	"node": "tcp://localhost:26657",
# 	"broadcast-mode": "sync"
# }
```

You can set your node configuration to send requests to a different network by changing the endpoint with:

```bash
butaned config node [tendermint-rpc-endpoint] \
--home ~/.tmp-butaned
```

Learn about more node configurations [here](configuration.mdx).

#### Queries

You can query information on the blockchain using `butaned query` (short `butaned q`). To view the account balances by its
 address stored in the bank module, use:

```bash
butaned q bank balances [adress] \
--home ~/.tmp-butaned
# # Example Output:
# balances:
# - amount: "99999000000000000000002500"
#   denom: abutane
```

To view other available query commands, use:

```bash
# for all Queries
butaned q

# for querying commands in the bank module
butaned q bank
```

#### Transactions

You can submit transactions to the network using `butaned tx`. This creates, signs and broadcasts a tx in one command. To
 send tokens from an account in the keyring to another address with the bank module, use:

```bash
butaned tx bank send [from_key_or_address] [to_address] [amount] \
--home ~/.tmp-butaned \
--fees 50000000000abutane \
-b block

# Example Output:
# ...
# txhash: 7BA2618295B789CC24BB13E654D9187CDD264F61FC446EB756EAC07AF3E7C40A
```

To view other available transaction commands, use:

```bash
# for all transaction commands
butaned tx

# for Bank transaction subcommands
butaned tx bank
```

Now that you've learned the basics of how to run and interact with an butane network,
head over to [configurations](configuration.mdx) for futher customization.
